![Tarantino'n'Rodriguez Movie Timeline](resources/tarantino-rodriguez-movies.png)

## Installation

### Compatibility

To get a version of this plugin which is compatible with your version of Kibana, have a look at the releases page on GitHub: https://github.com/walterra/kibana-milestones-vis/releases

In the "Assets" section of each release you'll find a zipped build of the plugin which you can use. These zip files are named in the following way: `kibana-<kibana-version>-milestones-vis-<plugin-version>.zip`.

### General Installation Pattern

Run the following from within your Kibana folder:

```
bin/kibana-plugin install https://github.com/walterra/kibana-milestones-vis/releases/download/v<version>/kibana-milestones-vis-<version>.zip
```

### Installing by first downloading a zipped release

- Head over to https://github.com/walterra/kibana-milestones-vis/releases and download the ZIP of the version you want to use, e.g. https://github.com/walterra/kibana-milestones-vis/releases/download/v1.0.0-alpha4/kibana-6.2.0-milestones-vis-1.0.0-alpha4.zip
- Inside your kibana directory, run `bin/kibana-plugin install file:///<path-to-file>/kibana-6.2.0-milestones-vis-1.0.0-alpha4.zip`, then `npm run start`
-

## Usage

- Create a Kibana index pattern including a time filter.
- Go to `Visualize > Create New Visualization` and choose the Milestones visualization in the Time Series section.
- In the next view, pick the index pattern you created.
- You should end up on the visualization's page where you can tweak it:
  - Make sure you have the right time span selected (upper right corner)
  - In the "Milestone Labels" configuration, choose a field for "Sort On" which you want to use for the labels. By default it just picks timestamps.
- The visualization works best with sparse data. While there is some optimization going on to distribute labels, you might get irritating results with data which results in too many labels.

## Wishlist/Upcoming

- ~~Automatic Labels for each timeline when there are multiple ones~~
- More intuitive initial setup of the visualization
- Option to switch to a vertical view and/or option to scroll
- ~~Use something more performant than the `top_hits` aggregation~~
- ~~Consolidate aggregation options (X-Axis and Options panel)~~
- Optimize label placement when there are lots of label closer to the boundary of the timeline
